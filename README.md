Python script to run the sun cinema. Electronics are powered by batteries that are charged from an array of flexible solar panels. Films are run off a Raspberry Pi, light from the sun illuminates an lcd screen and is imaged on a screen on the floor of a yurt.

This software is to check light levels using a photiode and use a motor to insert an LED array if the sunlight level goes too low. There is also a thermocouple on the LED array to ensure it does not overheat.
